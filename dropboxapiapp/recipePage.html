		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>1.5 cups all-purpose flour; more for your workspace</p>
		<p>1/2 cup cake flour</p>
		<p>1-3 tablespoons sugar (less for savory pies)</p>
		<p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
		<p>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</p>
		<p>1/2 cup water, chilled</p>
		<p>1/4 cup vegetable oil, chilled</p>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>	
		<li>Put all the dry ingredients into a food processor and pulse briefly to combine.</li>
		<li>Add the cubes of butter, and pulse for 3 seconds at a time, until the butter is the size of peas. The dough should stick together slightly if you squeeze it with your fingers.</li>
		<li>With the food processor running, slowly pour in the water and vegetable oil. Stop processing when the dough balls up.</li>
		<li>On a well-floured surface, dump the dough into one pile. Using the heel of your hand, scrape the dough bit by bit into a single ball of dough (you should be able to see butter smears in the dough as you do this; if you can't, you blended it too much in the food processor.</li>
		<li>Gather up the dough, and wrap it in wax paper.</li>
		<li>Refrigerate for at least one day before using. When rolling out to use in a pie, only roll out one half at a time, keeping the other one chilled in the fridge.</li>
